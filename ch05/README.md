# Duck Typing

---

> In the field of computer programming, duck typing is a type of dynamic typing, 
> where a set of variables and methods of an object determines the type of an object. 
> Rather than classifying types by class inheritance or interface implementation, 
> Duck Typing treats an object as belonging to that type if it has variables and 
> methods suitable for a type. The term "duck typing" comes from the duck test.
